# Programming Concepts
# "Movie List"

# Define initial values for loops.
movielist = 0
number = 0

# Set our list to be empty.
moviestor = []

# Display the first message before the loop.
print "What are your top ten favorite Netflix movies?"

# Start the loop for the 10 movie titles. Loop ends after 10 items are reached.
while movielist < 10:
    movies = raw_input("Please enter the movie's title: ")
    moviestor.append(movies)
    movielist = movielist + 1

# Display the message before our list loop.
print "\nYour top ten favorite movies are:"

# Loop for displaying the 10 movies. I wanted to display it in a list, using the #1. (title) method. This seems to be the best way to do that.
for i in moviestor:
    number = number + 1
    print "#"+str(number)+".", i
